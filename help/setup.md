## Step 2

To check whether Figma links associated with the desktop app, click the demo link **[Iconic Icon Set by Ryan Putnam](http://www.figma.com/file/4UApXbATsMrvF48asT2qiU/Iconic-Volume-1?node-id=0%3A1)**.

## Step 3

If Figma opened, skip all the next steps. The extension is ready for use. üëç

If you need to open a shared link in Chrome tab instead of Figma desktop app, you can switch the extension off by clicking on the extension icon.
